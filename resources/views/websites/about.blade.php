            <h1 class="mb-4">We are CITISec</h1>
            <p>Citi Security and Technology was created in September 2021 with the goal of providing homes and business
              enterprises with security and technology solutions.
              Private owners who install CCTV and the broader public have a range of benefits, but the primary benefit
              is
              that it enables company owners and homeowners to catch criminals in the act using film captured by the
              cameras.
              It also improves the likelihood of correctly identifying criminals, offers "eyes-on" throughout all areas
              covered by the system, which discourages thieves, and functions as a neighborhood watch, which makes an
              entire
              area less likely to be the target of crimes. </p>

            <p>As a result of the fact that the majority of private companies and households are unable to pay the risk
              of
              loss and damage to their homes,
              as well as private security staff, CCTV systems are fast growing as a compromise between vigilance in
              safety,
              security, peace-of-mind, and affordability. In fact, it's almost certain to be true,
              as shown by the huge rise in the number of private CCTV systems installed by businesses and homes
            </p>

            <p>When you work with Citi Security, you can be assured that you will receive after-sale service that is
              unmatched in quality, well-trained experts who are always on the move,
              and round-the-clock technical support that has been customized for the safety of your homes and
              businesses.
              Citi Security is a well-established business who have branches in Manila, Cavite,
              Lipa and soon in Bulacan. Citi Security makes certain that all work is completed to the customers'
              satisfaction before any payment transactions take place. The installation of CCTV systems by Citi Security
              guarantees complete protection against intrusion from the outside or even in the inside.
